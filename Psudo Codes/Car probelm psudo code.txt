Car1 cost = 10000$
Car2 cost = 15000$
fuel efficiency = number of miles traveled/number of liters consumed 
price per gallon = 4$
annual fuel cost = annual mile driven/fuel efficiency
annual gallon fueled = annual fuel cost * ppg
total cost = year to keep car * annual gallon fueled + car cost
if car1 > car2
	return car2
